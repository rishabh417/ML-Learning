## Learning Topics

This repository covers the following core Python concepts:

### Fundamental Programming
- **Assignment 1 & 2**: Basic syntax, data types, control flow, and functions

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes, instance methods, and attributes
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and super()
- **Polymorphism**: Dynamic dispatch and interface design
- **Encapsulation**: Access modifiers and data protection

### Advanced Concepts
- **Exception Handling**: Try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and error management
- **File Handling**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files
- **Iterators & Generators**: Custom iteration protocols and generator functions
- **Decorators**: Function and class decorators for code enhancement

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishabh417/ML-Learning.git
   cd ML-Learning
   ```

2. **Verify Python installation** (Python 3.7 or higher recommended):
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

Each assignment folder contains two types of Jupyter Notebooks:

- **`*questions.ipynb`**: Problem statements and prompts for hands-on practice
- **`*solution.ipynb`**: Complete solutions with explanations

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Install Jupyter** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Navigate to an assignment folder**:
   ```bash
   cd assignments/python/assignment_1
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the notebook file** in your browser and work through the exercises

### Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with `assignment_1` and `assignment_2` for Python fundamentals
2. Progress to `oops_assignment` and `classobject_assignment` for OOP concepts
3. Explore `inheritance_assignment` for advanced OOP patterns
4. Study `exceptional_handling_assignment` for robust error handling
5. Practice with `filehandlingquestions` for real-world I/O scenarios
6. Advance to `iter_gen_deco_assignment` for sophisticated Python patterns

## Assignments

| Assignment | Topic | Focus Area |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Assignment 1 | Python Fundamentals | Syntax, data types, control flow |
| Assignment 2 | Intermediate Concepts | Functions, problem-solving |
| OOPS Assignment | Object-Oriented Design | Classes, inheritance, polymorphism |
| Classes/Objects | OOP Fundamentals | Class definition and instantiation |
| Inheritance | Advanced OOP | Inheritance hierarchies and method overriding |
| Exception Handling | Error Management | Try-except, custom exceptions |
| File Handling | I/O Operations | Reading, writing, file manipulation |
| Iterators/Generators/Decorators | Advanced Python | Functional programming paradigms |

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development
- **NumPy** (optional): For some advanced exercises
- **Pandas** (optional): For data manipulation exercises

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas
```

## Getting Started

### For Beginners

1. Start with the foundational assignments to build strong Python basics
2. Review the solution notebooks after attempting each problem
3. Run code cells individually to understand each concept
4. Modify example code to experiment and learn

### For Intermediate Learners

1. Skip the foundational assignments and start with OOP concepts
2. Practice problems before viewing solutions
3. Extend the assignments with your own variations
4. Create additional test cases for robustness

### Best Practices

- **Write code regularly**: Consistent practice is key to mastery
- **Understand before memorizing**: Focus on comprehension over rote learning
- **Experiment**: Modify example code and observe the results
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify your solutions with various test cases
- **Review solutions**: Compare your approach with provided solutions

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/improvement`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add improvement'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/improvement`)
5. Open a Pull Request
